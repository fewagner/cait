>>>Remarks on the Standardevent and the Noise Power Spectrum:

If there is no standard event available for a detector, it can get constructed like this: The easiest form of a Standardevent is the point-wise mean of many pulses. For better standard events some cleaning algorithm can be employed, e.g. the first constructed Standardevent can be fit back to all event from which it is constructed (fit parameters: height, baseline offset). Then all events that give a high fit-error (i.e. all events that do not look like the standardevent) get thrown away and from all others a new standard event is constructed. This can be repeated several times and results very likely in a very beautiful pulse-shape.

The Noise Power Spectrum is as a mean of the noise power spectra of many baselines. Usually, about 2% of all hardware-taken baselines are not clear, but have artifacts like pulses, spikes, etc. This has to be cleaned first, i.e. by a low pass filter and then a treshhold, all baselines that exceed that treshhold for some sample get thrown away. The 98% clean baselines are then fourier transformed. The noise power spectrum (NPS) is the squared absolut value of the fourier transformation. Then take the mean of the NPS of all baselines.

>>>Remark on the Optimal Filter in General:

The Optimal Filter is the frequency filter which provides the highest possible signal-to-noise ratio for the time tau_M (this is usually chosen as the time of the peak of the standardevent), if: 
    -) the event is exactly shaped like the standard event
    -) the noise has the exact frequency spectrum of the nps we provide 
In applications those requirements will never be perfectly fulfilled, so we will never reach the actual upper limit of the signal-to-noise ratio. Still, it is the best we can do with a frequency filter.
