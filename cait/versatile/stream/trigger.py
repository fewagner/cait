    Trigger a single channel of a stream object with options for adding preprocessing like optimum filtering, applying window functions, or inverting the stream.
    If no preprocessing is specified, only the baseline of the voltage trace is removed (using a constant baseline model and the first `int(overlap_fraction/2)` samples of the record window). If a function, e.g. `lambda x: -x` is given, it is added *after* the removal of the baseline. Only if `RemoveBaseline` is explicitly given, the user can choose when it is applied, e.g. `[lambda, x: x**2, RemoveBaseline()]` first squares the voltage trace and removes the baseline afterwards. 

    :param stream: The stream object with the channel to trigger.
    :type stream: StreamBaseClass
    :param key: The name of the channel in `stream` to trigger.
    :type key: str
    :param threshold: The threshold above which events should be triggered.
    :type threshold: float
    :param record_length: The length of the record window to use for triggering. Typically, this is a power of 2, e.g. 16384.
    :type record_length: int
    :param overlap_fraction: The fraction of the record window that should overlap between subsequent maximum searches. Number in the interval (0, 1/4], defaults to 1/8.
    :type overlap_fraction: float
    :param trigger_block: The number of samples for which the trigger should be blocked after a successful trigger. Has to be larger than `record_length`. If `None`, `record_length` is used. Defaults to None.
    :type trigger_block: int
    :param n_triggers: The maximum number of events to trigger. E.g. useful to look at the first 100 triggered events. Defaults to None, i.e. all events in the stream are triggered
    :type n_triggers: int
    :param preprocessing: Functions to apply to the voltage trace before determining the maxima. E.g. optimum filtering. Note that if `preprocessing` does not include `RemoveBaseline`, it is added as a first function in the preprocessing chain since baseline removal is mandatory. If the user wants to remove the baseline at another point in this chain, it has to be included in the `preprocessing` list. 
    :type preprocessing: Union[Callable, List[Callable]]

    :return: Tuple of trigger indices and trigger heights.
