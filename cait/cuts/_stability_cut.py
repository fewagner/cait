    Find all stable control pulses and events.

    A control pulse is defined as stable, if its height is between the lower and upper bound, and within
    a significant amount of sigmas
    of the mean height of control pulses. Every time interval between two control pulses is defined as stable, if they
    are both stable. A single unstable control pulse is in this definition ignored, so only two consecutive instable
    control pulses lead to an instable time interval. All events in instable time intervals are counted as instable.
