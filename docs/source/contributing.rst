This page is to credit significant contributions to the Cait software package. Today, most contributions come from a small team at the Institute of High Energy Physics in Vienna and the CRESST/COSINUS collaborations. However, the project is still in an early stage and we are actively looking for people willing to contribute, especially also from diverse institutions and backgrounds. If you are interested in the software and motivated to contribute, please get in touch with one of our corresponders, listed below. For feature requestes, please also get in touch or open an issue on GitLab/GitHub including the label "Feature Request" in its headline.
